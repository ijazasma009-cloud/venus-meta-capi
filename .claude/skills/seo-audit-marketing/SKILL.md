# SEO Audit Framework

You are an expert SEO strategist who understands that organic search is the compound interest of digital marketing — small improvements accumulate into significant competitive advantages over time.

## The SEO Audit Philosophy

Most SEO audits produce 50-page reports that collect dust. This framework prioritizes ruthlessly — focusing on changes that actually move rankings and traffic, not theoretical best practices.

**The goal isn't a perfect score. It's more qualified traffic that converts.**

---

## Before You Audit

### Business Context First

SEO doesn't exist in a vacuum. Understand:

**1. What pages actually matter?**
- Which pages drive revenue?
- Which keywords have commercial intent?
- Where does organic traffic fit in the funnel?

**2. What's the competitive landscape?**
- Who ranks for your target keywords?
- What's their domain authority vs. yours?
- Are you fighting realistic battles?

**3. What's the traffic trend?**
- Overall organic traffic: up, down, flat?
- Specific pages or sections affected?
- Any correlation with algorithm updates?

**4. What's already been tried?**
- Recent site changes or migrations?
- Previous SEO work?
- Known technical issues?

### Data Sources Required

**Essential:**
- Google Search Console (3+ months data)
- Google Analytics 4 (with proper setup)
- Access to the live website

**Highly Valuable:**
- Crawl data (Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, or similar)
- Backlink data (Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz)
- Competitor rankings data

**Nice to Have:**
- Historical ranking data
- Core Web Vitals field data
- Server logs

## The Audit Hierarchy

Audit in this order — earlier items block later ones:

```
1. CRAWLABILITY     Can Google find your pages?
        ↓
2. INDEXABILITY     Can Google index your pages?
        ↓
3. TECHNICAL        Is your site fast and functional?
        ↓
4. ON-PAGE          Are pages optimized for target keywords?
        ↓
5. CONTENT          Does content deserve to rank?
        ↓
6. AUTHORITY        Does your site have credibility?
```

If Google can't crawl your pages, nothing else matters. Fix foundational issues first.

## Level 1: Crawlability Audit

### Robots.txt Analysis

**Check for:**
```
Location: domain.com/robots.txt
```

**Critical issues:**
- [ ] Blocking important pages or sections
- [ ] Blocking CSS/JS (breaks rendering)
- [ ] Blocking entire site (`Disallow: /`)
- [ ] Different rules for different bots causing issues
- [ ] Missing or malformed robots.txt

**Correct structure example:**
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /cart/
Disallow: /checkout/
Disallow: /account/
Disallow: /search?
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

### XML Sitemap Analysis

**Sitemap checklist:**
- [ ] Exists and is accessible
- [ ] Referenced in robots.txt
- [ ] Submitted to Search Console
- [ ] Contains only canonical, indexable URLs
- [ ] Updated automatically when content changes
- [ ] Under 50MB / 50,000 URLs per sitemap
- [ ] Uses sitemap index for larger sites
- [ ] Returns 200 status code

**Common sitemap issues:**
| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Includes noindex pages | Wastes crawl budget | Remove from sitemap |
| Includes redirected URLs | Confuses crawlers | Include final destinations only |
| Outdated/stale | New content not discovered | Automate updates |
| Missing priority pages | Important pages not crawled | Add missing URLs |
| 404s in sitemap | Wastes crawl budget | Remove dead URLs |

### Site Architecture Analysis

**Crawl depth audit:**
- Homepage = Level 0
- Pages linked from homepage = Level 1
- Pages linked from Level 1 = Level 2
- And so on...

**Best practice:**
- Important pages within 3 clicks of homepage
- Flat architecture preferred (fewer levels)
- Clear category/subcategory structure

**Internal linking issues:**
- [ ] Orphan pages (no internal links pointing to them)
- [ ] Deep pages (more than 4 clicks from homepage)
- [ ] Important pages with few internal links
- [ ] Broken internal links (404s)
- [ ] Redirect chains in internal links

### Crawl Budget Considerations

**For large sites (10,000+ pages):**
- [ ] Faceted navigation under control (noindex or canonicals)
- [ ] Pagination handled properly
- [ ] Parameter URLs managed
- [ ] Session IDs not in URLs
- [ ] Infinite scroll with pagination fallback
- [ ] No crawl traps (calendars, filters creating infinite URLs)

---

## Level 2: Indexability Audit

### Index Coverage Check

**In Search Console:**
1. Go to Indexing > Pages
2. Review "Why pages aren't indexed" reasons
3. Prioritize by page importance

**Key metrics:**
- Total indexed pages vs. expected
- Trend over time (increasing or decreasing?)
- Ratio of indexed to submitted

**Quick index check:**
```
site:yourdomain.com
```
Compare result count to expected indexed pages.

### Common Indexation Issues

**Noindex problems:**
- [ ] Important pages accidentally noindexed
- [ ] Noindex in HTTP header AND meta tag (redundant)
- [ ] Noindex on pages that should rank

**Canonical issues:**
- [ ] Self-referencing canonicals missing
- [ ] Canonicals pointing to wrong pages
- [ ] Cross-domain canonicals unintentional
- [ ] HTTP/HTTPS canonical conflicts
- [ ] www/non-www canonical conflicts
- [ ] Trailing slash inconsistencies

**Duplicate content:**
- [ ] Same content accessible via multiple URLs
- [ ] Print pages not canonicalized
- [ ] UTM parameters creating duplicates
- [ ] Staging sites indexed
- [ ] HTTP and HTTPS both indexed

### Canonical Audit Checklist

```
For each important page, verify:

1. Page has a canonical tag
2. Canonical is self-referencing (for unique pages)
3. Canonical uses preferred domain version
4. Canonical uses HTTPS
5. Canonical has consistent trailing slash
6. Canonical matches what Google selected (in Search Console)
```

**Check Google's selected canonical:**
Search Console > URL Inspection > Enter URL > See "Google-selected canonical"

If Google selected a different canonical than you specified, investigate why.

## Level 3: Technical SEO Audit

### Core Web Vitals

**The three metrics:**

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Loading performance | < 2.5s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Interactivity | < 200ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability | < 0.1 |

**Where to check:**
1. Search Console > Core Web Vitals report (field data)
2. PageSpeed Insights (lab + field data)
3. Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse

**Field data vs. lab data:**
- Field data = Real users (more accurate, slower to update)
- Lab data = Simulated (immediate, but not real conditions)

### Page Speed Deep Dive

**LCP issues and fixes:**
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Large images | Compress, use WebP/AVIF, lazy load |
| Slow server response | Upgrade hosting, use CDN, caching |
| Render-blocking resources | Defer non-critical CSS/JS |
| Client-side rendering | Server-side render critical content |

**INP issues and fixes:**
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Heavy JavaScript | Code split, defer, lazy load |
| Long tasks blocking main thread | Break up tasks, use web workers |
| Too many event listeners | Optimize, use event delegation |

**CLS issues and fixes:**
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Images without dimensions | Add width/height attributes |
| Ads/embeds without reserved space | Set explicit dimensions |
| Web fonts causing FOIT/FOUT | font-display: swap, preload |
| Dynamically injected content | Reserve space in CSS |

### Mobile Friendliness

**Critical checks:**
- [ ] Responsive design (not separate m. site)
- [ ] Viewport meta tag configured
- [ ] Tap targets 48px+ with 8px+ spacing
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling required
- [ ] Text readable without zooming (16px+ base)
- [ ] Same content as desktop version

**Mobile-first indexing:**
Google indexes the mobile version of your site. If mobile is missing content that desktop has, that content won't be indexed.

### HTTPS & Security

**HTTPS checklist:**
- [ ] Entire site on HTTPS (no mixed content)
- [ ] Valid SSL certificate (not expired)
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] HSTS header implemented
- [ ] No certificate errors

**Security headers to check:**
```
Strict-Transport-Security
X-Content-Type-Options
X-Frame-Options
Content-Security-Policy
```

### URL Structure Audit

**Best practices:**
- [ ] Descriptive, keyword-relevant slugs
- [ ] Lowercase letters only
- [ ] Hyphens between words (not underscores)
- [ ] No unnecessary parameters
- [ ] Reasonable length (under 100 characters)
- [ ] Consistent structure across site

**URL issues to flag:**
| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| `/page?id=123` | `/product-name` |
| `/Category/Sub_Category/` | `/category/sub-category/` |
| `/2024/01/15/post-title` | `/blog/post-title` |
| `/products/ITEM-NAME` | `/products/item-name` |

### Redirect Audit

**Check for:**
- [ ] Redirect chains (A → B → C — should be A → C)
- [ ] Redirect loops (A → B → A)
- [ ] 302s that should be 301s
- [ ] Redirects to non-canonical URLs
- [ ] Excessive redirects slowing crawling

**Redirect chain fix:**
Before: Old Page → Redirect 1 → Redirect 2 → Final Page
After: Old Page → Final Page (single 301)

---

## Level 4: On-Page SEO Audit

### Title Tag Analysis

**Audit each important page:**

| Check | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Has title tag | Yes |
| Length | 50-60 characters visible |
| Primary keyword | Near beginning |
| Unique | No duplicates site-wide |
| Compelling | Encourages clicks |
| Brand | At end (if included) |

**Title formula that works:**
```
[Primary Keyword] - [Benefit/Modifier] | [Brand]

Examples:
SEO Audit Checklist - 47 Points for 2024 | Moz
Best CRM Software for Small Business - Free Trial | HubSpot
```

**Common title issues:**
- [ ] Missing titles
- [ ] Duplicate titles across pages
- [ ] Keyword stuffing
- [ ] Too long (truncated in SERPs)
- [ ] Too short (wasted opportunity)
- [ ] Not compelling (low CTR)

### Meta Description Analysis

**Audit each important page:**

| Check | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Has meta description | Yes |
| Length | 150-160 characters |
| Includes primary keyword | Naturally |
| Unique | No duplicates |
| Call to action | Where appropriate |
| Matches page content | Accurately |

**Note:** Google often rewrites meta descriptions. Focus on the most important pages and monitor what Google actually shows.

### Heading Structure Audit

**Proper heading hierarchy:**
```
<h1>Main Page Title (one per page)</h1>
  <h2>Major Section</h2>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Major Section</h2>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
```

**Heading issues:**
- [ ] Missing H1
- [ ] Multiple H1s
- [ ] Skipped levels (H1 → H3)
- [ ] H1 doesn't include primary keyword
- [ ] Headings used for styling only
- [ ] Important content not in headings

### Image Optimization

**For each important image:**
- [ ] Descriptive filename (`red-running-shoes.jpg` not `IMG_3847.jpg`)
- [ ] Alt text present and descriptive
- [ ] Compressed file size
- [ ] Modern format (WebP/AVIF with fallbacks)
- [ ] Lazy loading for below-fold images
- [ ] Responsive images (srcset)
- [ ] Explicit width/height attributes

### Internal Link Audit

**Check for:**
- [ ] Descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- [ ] Important pages have many internal links
- [ ] Logical link relationships
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] Excessive links diluting value

**Internal linking opportunities:**
1. Find top-performing pages (most traffic/links)
2. Find relevant pages that could link to them
3. Add contextual links where natural

### Keyword Optimization Check

**For each target page:**
- [ ] Primary keyword in title
- [ ] Primary keyword in H1
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] Primary keyword in URL (if possible)
